- Given a DOS-formattted text file (lines end with \r\n rather than just \n)

To convert a file from DOS format to normal text format, all you need to
run is

sed -i 's/\r\n/\n/g' FILENAME

in terminal. This will edit the file directly. (1)



Notes:

(1) To write the output from sed to a new file (instead of editing in
place), run the same replacement command without the '-i' flag and with
the '> DESINATION' command instead. For example, for converting DOS to
standard text format, you would run

sed 's/\r\n/\n/g' SOURCE > DESINATION

instead of

sed -i 's/\r\n/\n/g' FILENAME
